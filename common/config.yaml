  graph_plot: "- The network plot visualizes the relationships between actors, with nodes representing actors and edges 
  representing their collaborations. The thickness of the edges indicate the frequency of their co-starring appearances.

  - In addition to the connections, the nodes (actors) are assigned colors based on the Louvain clustering algorithm. 
  Louvain clustering aims to identify communities or groups of closely connected actors within the graph. The assigned 
  colors help distinguish different clusters and provide insights into the community structure within the actor network.
  
  - This plot utilizes the D3Blocks library, which implements a force-directed algorithm to generate 
  a visually appealing network plot. The force-directed algorithm simulates the behavior of physical forces among 
  the nodes, arranging them in a way that minimizes edge crossings and maximizes the overall aesthetic of the graph."

  graph_metrics: "- Degree Centrality: Degree centrality measures how connected an actor is by looking at the number of co-stars 
  they have worked with. Actors with a higher degree centrality value have worked with more co-stars.
  
  - Betweenness Centrality: Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which an actor acts as a bridge or 
  intermediary between other actors in the graph. In real terms, an actor who has starred in a number of different 
  franchises is likely to have a high betweeness centrality.
  
  - Eigenvector Centrality: Eigenvector centrality measures the influence of an actor based on both their direct 
  connections and the connections of their co-stars. Actors with high eigenvector centrality are not only connected to 
  many other actors but are also connected to other influential actors.
  
  - Clustering Coefficient: The clustering coefficient measures the tendency of actors to form tightly-knit groups or 
  clusters. It quantifies how likely an actor's co-stars are also connected to each other. Actors with high clustering 
  coefficients are part of cohesive groups within the network."
